        The goal of this game is collecting sets of four cards in shortest time possible.
        Each card represents a unique set of colors (hence, there are 128 cards).
        Four cards are a valid set if every color appears on an even number of these.
        (In other words, if the symmetric sum (xor) of there four sets is empty).
        If you are not very familiar with the concept of symmetric sum, feel free to experiment:
